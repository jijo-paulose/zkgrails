# ZKGrails: ZK plugin for Grails #

### We are raising funds to rewrite ZKGrails for Grails 2.4 and beyond ###

After rewriting, ZKGrails will be fully available on Github. Please support us. [Help us move ZKGrails forwards and being more accessible !!](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/zkgrails/fundraiser)

### ZKGrails 2.5.2 have been released !! ###

ZKGrails is a plugin for the next generation rapid Web development framework, [Grails](http://grails.org). Based on [ZK](http://zkoss.org), one of the leading RIA frameworks, ZKGrails adds and enhances its RIA development capabilities and seamlessly integrates it with Grails' infrastructures. This results in an advanced RIA framework featuring direct AJAX and convention-over-configuration.

**Looking for a demo?** Here's [Zello](http://zello.herokuapp.com/), a simple [Trello](http://trello.com)-clone developed using the latest version of ZKGrails - User: demo, Password: demo. You may notice Zello's running faster than several ZK applications you've tried. **Zello is highly optimized for responsiveness using a programming model permitted by Groovy**. Zello 0.9 is developed using Grails 2.2.2 and ZKGrails 2.2.1.

  * Latest Public Stable: [ZKGrails 2.5.2](http://repo.grails.org/grails/plugins/org/grails/plugins/zk/2.5.2/zk-2.5.2.zip) (ZK 7.0.3 & Grails 2.3 - 2.3.11)

&lt;wiki:gadget url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/381580/zkgrails/intro.xml" width="450" height="350"/&gt;

## Quick Start ##
In your app's `grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy`, add the Bintray repository like the following:
```
repositories {
    inherits true
    mavenRepo "http://dl.bintray.com/zkgrails/release"
    ...
}
```

Next, in the `plugins` block, put the following lines:
```
plugins {
    compile ":zk:2.5.2"              // ZK plugin
    compile ":zk-angular:1.0.0.M3"   // ZK Angular support
    compile ":zk-bootstrap:1.0.0"    // ZK Bootstrap support
    compile ":zk-atlantic:1.0.1"     // ZK Atlantic flat theme
    ...
}
```

Then
```
$ grails refresh-dependencies
```

Type
```
$ grails create-zul index
```
will give you
  * `grails-app/zul/index.zul` linked with `IndexComposer`
  * `grails-app/composers/IndexComposer.groovy`, the composer class.

Then
```
$ grails run-app
```

and point your browser to
```
http://localhost:8080/<your app>/index.zul
```

As of version 0.7, auto reloading is fully supported.

To create only a composer, you can type $ `grails create-composer <name>`.

If you are going to create zul files manually, please use this template for your .zul files. `AnnotateDataBinderInit` is for data-binding support. `DelegatingVariableResolver` is for injecting Spring beans, and `GroovyGrails` is for making Grails classes work for you.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?init class="org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.AnnotateDataBinderInit" ?>
<?variable-resolver class="org.zkoss.zkplus.spring.DelegatingVariableResolver"?>

<?page zscriptLanguage="GroovyGrails"?>
```
